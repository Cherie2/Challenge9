## Motivation
  The motivation for this project is to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to produce a professional readme file. The readme file's template includes sections such as the project title, description, and table of contents etc. The user is then able to decide which sections are relevant to their project.

  In completing this project, I have learned the basic concepts of node.js and specifically the inquirer package, as well as how to scrren record through screencastify.
